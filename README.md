# PYTHON
With this project, my professor instructed me to construct a simple
client and server that would read in a data file on the client-side 
and send the contents of the file to the server, which would then sort
the contents and print out the number of times each word appears in the data file.

It was a simple exercise to familiarize myself with the construction
of a client and server and allowed for a study of how the connection 
between the two entities is formed and maintained.
